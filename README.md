This is a work in progress so don't be too quick to judge, today is the sites birthday, literally :)
Ok so this site is one day old and today I spent most of the day messing about with CVs and job sites. Meh! 
I'll have to do some work tonight. Nope didn't do any, ended up doing some git work though. Trying to find a sensible way to do this. 
This site is a just a few days old and it's already moving to [here](https://welfitt.github.io)
